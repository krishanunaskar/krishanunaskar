### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Krishanu**, an AI content artist and creative technologist from India.

I work at the intersection of AI, filmmaking and technical workflows — building tools and content pipelines for trailers, branded content, and short-form visual storytelling.

On the technical side, I experiment with Minecraft server development, Discord systems, and small automation tools.

My current focus is bridging **AI-driven video tools** with **production workflows**, making it faster to ideate, prototype and ship content.

I’ve put a few projects on my GitHub, but most of my experiments are private or unlisted.

#### Fun Facts:

- I don’t drink coffee  
- Good cinema still hits hard  
- I cook dinner late at night  
- **Hobbies:** movies, gym, building things
